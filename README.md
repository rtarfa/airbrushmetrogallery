- Created a virtual reality/3D exhibition space to showcase both the historical and contemporary elements of go-go music and culture- including the foundational role Black women play in the Go-Go music scene- and was interviewed by Makers Lab DC to discuss the process
- Used Mozilla Spoke to build the 3D gallery space, which depicts an area of Washington, D.C. crucial to the go-go scene and exhibits a film created by Zakiya, member of the RHC film cohort.
- The Respect Her Crank Go-Go Herstory Showcase was held on August 29th, where hundreds of guests virtually visited the 3D spaces.
